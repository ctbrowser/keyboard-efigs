Summary
=======

This is the repository for keyboard-efigs, the default webOS pluggable shared library for the virtual keyboard.

keyboard-efigs
==============

This is the pluggable keyboard component based on the original Open webOS keyboard. 
It is optimized for tablet and phone layouts, and provides support for locales based on the English, French, Italian, German and Spanish languages.

In addition to being the default keyboard for Open webOS, 
this component provides a full example of how to implement pluggable keyboard components for Open webOS.

The discovery system of Open webOS will detect available pluggable keyboard components and 
then select the one with the best fit for locale and screen format.

How to Build on Linux
=====================

This component is in the development phase and is not yet individually buildable.
